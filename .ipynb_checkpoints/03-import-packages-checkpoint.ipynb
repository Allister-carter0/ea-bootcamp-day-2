    "## Python Packages and Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a package in Python as a tool box of organized code (i.e. functions) that can be used to perform different operations - like produce a plot. In `Python`, packages are organized directories of code that can be imported and used in your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this Bootcamp course, you will use the following packages:\n",
    "1. `os` - to access files and directories on the computer\n",
    "2. `numpy` - to store and access data in arrays (i.e. ordered series)\n",
    "3. `pandas` - to store and access data as dataframes (i.e. tabular data with rows and columns)\n",
    "4. `matplotlib` - to plot data\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages can contain many modules (i.e. units of code) that each provide different functions and can build on each other. For example, the `matplotlib` package provides functionality to plot data using modules, one of which is the commonly used module called `pyplot`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every `Python` package should have a unique name. This allows you to import the package using the name with the `import` command. For example, the command below imports the `matplotlib` package. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules in different packages may have the same name. Thus, you call a specific module by first calling the package name and then the module name - using `.` to separate the names like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aliases\n",
    "\n",
    "When you import packages and modules, you can assign an alias to that package or module which you can use to call  it in your code without having to type out the full name. Thus, aliases can be helpful to shorten the names of packages or modules and can help to distinguish modules that have the same name. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can expand your `import` statement to assign an alias to a package or module by adding the command `as` followed by the alias name (e.g. `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now every time you want to use `matplotlib.pyplot`, you can type `plt` instead. You will explore the use of aliases in this lesson. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import Python Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward in this course, you will now always begin your `Python` code by importing the necessary packages, so that you can begin with all the functionality you need for your workflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by importing the `os` package which provides functionality to access files and directories on the computer."
